                <p>Body Story was built on one simple idea: activewear that actually works in hot weather. Founded by two Malaysians, the brand reflects the spirit of our country: inclusive, multicultural, and made for everyone. From the beginning, our focus has been clear. We want to create sportswear that is comfortable, performance driven, and stylish.</p>

                <p>Our journey began with the Body Story TieFit Sports Tudung. It is UV blocking, cooling, sweat wicking, and incredibly lightweight. This was our real "a-ha" moment. For years, we kept asking ourselves why there wasn't a sport hijab that isn't hot, and offers UV-protection. We mention this first product in our About Us because it shaped everything we stand for. It filled an important gap. Muslim people living in tropical heat need proper UV protection, and this tudung became the perfect example of our vision. It continues to guide everything we create next.</p>

                <p>Our name, Body Story, carries the heart of our brand. Every person has a different story. Every body moves differently, grows differently, and carries its own journey. When we move our bodies, we are writing new chapters of that story. Our mission is not only to make high quality activewear, but also to remind people how important it is to stay active and to enjoy moving their bodies.</p>
